            <strong>Machine Learning Model Hosting environment</strong>
            Built using a layered container approach for real-time fraud detection. 
            The system leveraged Red Hat Python base images and integrated Kafka consumers/producers, 
            model estimator logic, and runtime configurations. It was deployed seamlessly on OpenShift, 
            enabling modular design for efficient CI/CD workflows, reduced operational overhead, 
            and support for high-throughput inference pipelines.
